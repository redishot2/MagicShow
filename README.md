Sugar Glider: The Game

A project made for Interactive Digital Media
The project was given the constraint to 
use Flash to create an interactive scene 
with three distinct pages and has an overriding theme. 
Magic week was my chosen theme and you can see 
that by the "magic show" feel of my product. 

Made in Flash. October 3rd, 2012.
